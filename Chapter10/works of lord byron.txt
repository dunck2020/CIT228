 I  must  not  omit  the  custom  of  handing round,  after  dinner,  
 on  the  removal  of  the cloth,  a  human  skull  filled  with  Burgundy. 
 After  revelling  on  choice  viands,  and  the finest  wines  of  France,  
 we  adjourned  to  tea, where  we  amused  ourselves  with  reading  or 
 improving  conversation, — each  according to  his  fancy, — and,  
 after  sandwiches,  &.C. retired  to  rest.  A  set  of  monkish  dresses 
 which  had  been  provided,  with  all  the  pro- per apparatus  of  
 crosses,  beads,  tonsures &c.  often  gave  a  variety  to  our  
 appearance, and  to  our  pursuits.
